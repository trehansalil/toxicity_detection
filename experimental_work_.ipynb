        "## Intro\n",
        "I am quite new in the field of data science and specially transformers are a very new concept to me. During my exploration for learning more about BERT, I noticed most of the material present on kaggle either discuss the underlying logics and modules in BERT model, (which is necessary for begginers) or they present blocks of code without much details. This material is an attempt to bridge the gap from the very basics and theory of BERT model to practicality of a simple model. <br>\n",
        "A lot of the work in this notebook is inspired by the work of [chumajin](https://www.kaggle.com/chumajin) from [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/chumajin/pytorch-bert-beginner-s-room). I would like to thank him here and would add that I have adapt it to our problem in this competetion. I have also added more visualization to see the imporvements of the models over iterations in epochs and during different folds.\n",

        "### Objective\n",
        "Creating a model which predicts the probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is presented to two parts. I have separted it in two parts, due to memory limitations in kaggle. You can run either part I or part II independantly. <br>\n",
        "In **part I** I try to explain the primary steps we need to take for handling similar tasks, for binary classification of different labels. The model in this part runs only for one distribuation of train set and validation set. and you can see the inital performance results(auc score) we get from this model. <br>\n",
        "In **part II**, I have braught all the necessary blocks of code from part I and then show how 5 models can be developed for different choices of train set and validation set as in k_fold (k = 5). The probablites for all types of toxicity for each comment is then estimated as mean value from these 5 models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Parameters affecting simulation time\n",
        "For running this noteboook quickly, to see how it works, in both part I and part II, you can reduce the training set to the limited number of rows. I took 200 rows in part I and 2000 in part II.<br>\n",
        "The reason for having it very low in part I is that the code opts for eductional resons rather than being efficient. Therefore, it reads in many different variables and cause the cuda memory crash if we go for more than 200 rows. This gives us an unimpressive results for part I. (accuracy 86%) <br>\n",
        "In part II, code is more consice compared to part I, and it's possible to raise number of rows to include the whole training set. However, I keep it limited to 2000, so you manage to get a fairly good result (94% accuracy and 0.988 auc score) in 22 min of simulation. <br>\n",
        "You can have (epochs = 5, k = 5) and see how the accuracy and losses imporve in different epochs. The accuracy and loss are in an acceptable range, as this notebook is not concerned about reaching the state-of-art results. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Hope that you find it useful and if so, please don't forget to upvote this note book, it makes my day! :-)"
